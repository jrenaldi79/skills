# Artifact Registry & Deliverables

## Artifact Management Rules

1. Every artifact gets a unique ID: `P[Phase#]-[Type]-[Sequence]`
2. Save every artifact as a file in `./artifacts/` (images in `./artifacts/images/`)
3. Reference previous artifacts by ID when making decisions
4. Maintain `./artifacts/artifact-index.md` and update at the end of each phase

**Auto-generated files (not manually created):**
- `index.html` — Project dashboard. Regenerated by `scripts/generate-dashboard.py` at every phase gate. Do not edit manually.

## Artifact Index Format

```markdown
## Artifact Index
| ID | Phase | Type | Description | Fidelity | DTS Result | File |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2-COMP-01 | 2 | Competitive Analysis | Landscape board: 5 competitors | Doc | N/A | ./artifacts/P2-COMP-01.md |
| P3-SKETCH-01 | 3 | Concept Sketch | "Flip Scale" — orthographic views | L1 | PASS | ./artifacts/P3-SKETCH-01.html |
```

- `P2-IMG-*` — Downloaded reference images

### Phase 3: Ideation
- `P3-SKETCH-*` — Concept sketches (one per concept)

### Phase 4: Refinement

- `P4-MATBOARD-01` — Material Selection Board
- `P4-IMG-RENDER-*` — Inspiration renders
- `P4-DIMSKETCH-01` — Dimensioned sketch

### Phase 5: FMEA
- `P5-FMEA-01` — Failure Mode Analysis

### Phase 6: Final Specification

## Parametric "Design Source of Truth" Files

To keep the design consistent across phases (like a codebase), maintain these machine-readable files:

### 1. `./CLAUDE.md` (Required)
The project's persistent context file. Created from `references/claude-md-template.md` during Phase 1 scaffolding. Updated at every phase gate. This is the agent's primary orientation tool when resuming a project in a new session.

### 2. `./artifacts/design-parameters.yaml` (Required)
Contains: overall dimensions, part thicknesses, radii/fillets, draft angles, clearances, datum references, mass targets.

### 3. `./artifacts/materials-and-finishes.yaml` (Required)
Contains: allowed materials, finish specs, color codes, texture/grip specs, regulatory constraints, supplier notes if available.

### 4. `./artifacts/decision-log.md` (Required)
Contains: dated entries recording what changed, why, what artifact informed the decision, and trade-offs considered.

### Rules
- Update these files whenever a dimension, material, or finish decision changes
- The final spec must match these files. If a conflict exists, resolve it and log the resolution
- All values must comply with the spec integrity policy (see `engineering-standards.md`)
