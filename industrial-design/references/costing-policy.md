# Costing & Sourcing Policy

Cost and material property claims are high-risk for hallucination. These rules keep estimates honest.

## Rules

### 1. Every Numeric Claim Must Be Either:
- **Sourced** — include URL + retrieval date
- **Estimated** — clearly labeled as estimate, include assumptions and range

### 2. Use Ranges by Default
Provide P10 / P50 / P90 estimates when real quotes aren't available.
- P10 = optimistic (best-case pricing, high volume, favorable terms)
- P50 = most likely
- P90 = pessimistic (low volume, premium suppliers, rush orders)

### 3. Tooling and Process Costs Must Specify:
- Region assumptions (e.g., US / EU / China)
- Production volume
- Finish and QC/testing assumptions

### 4. If Web Tools Are Unavailable
Proceed with **Assumption Mode** and request the user's target vendors/quotes for refinement. Clearly label all cost figures as assumptions based on general industry knowledge.
