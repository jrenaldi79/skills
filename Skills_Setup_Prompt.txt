I need you to help me set up my Windows machine with a skills library and onboard me to the system.

Please do the following steps IN ORDER:

**STEP 1: Create Admin Verification Shortcuts**

Create two desktop shortcuts for ChatWise (IMPORTANT, you MUST first check if they exist before creating them):

1. Create a shortcut called "ChatWise (Admin).lnk" that always runs as administrator
2. Create a shortcut called "ChatWise (Regular).lnk" that runs as a regular user

Both shortcuts should point to: C:\Users\[my-username]\AppData\Local\ChatWise\chatwise.exe

The admin shortcut needs the "Run as administrator" flag set (modify byte 0x15 to include flag 0x20).

Once created, ask me to confirm I can see both shortcuts on my desktop before proceeding.

**STEP 2: Restart ChatWise as Administrator (CRITICAL)**

Once shortcuts are confirmed, instruct me to:

1. Close this ChatWise window completely
2. Open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) and kill all "chatwise.exe" processes under the Processes tab. Please note, users will be using Windows as a virtual machine so some users will be on a mac and some on Windows so give them the right key sequence based on what type of laptop they are using.
3. Double-click the "ChatWise (Admin).lnk" shortcut on my desktop
4. When the UAC prompt appears, click "Yes" to run as administrator
5. Return to this conversation and type "I'm back as admin"
**DO NOT PROCEED BEYOND THIS POINT UNTIL I RETURN**

**STEP 3: Verify Admin Privileges (MUST PASS)**

Once I return, verify I'm running as administrator by running this PowerShell command:

```powershell
([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)
```

This MUST return "True". If it returns "False":
- Stop immediately
- Tell me I'm not running as admin
- Have me repeat Step 2
- Do NOT proceed to Step 4

If it returns "True", confirm "✓ Admin privileges verified" and proceed to Step 4.

**STEP 4: Clone Skills Repository**

Clone the GitHub repository from https://github.com/jrenaldi79/skills. The user doesn't have Git so you must use something similar to: using Git:

```powershell

# Download and extract a GitHub repo
$repoUrl = "https://github.com/username/repository"
$zipUrl = "$repoUrl/archive/refs/heads/main.zip"  # or "master" instead of "main"
$outputPath = "C:\path\to\destination"

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $zipUrl -OutFile "$env:TEMP\repo.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "$env:TEMP\repo.zip" -DestinationPath $outputPath -Force
Remove-Item "$env:TEMP\repo.zip"

```

Make sure the zip file is unzipped and placed into the C:\Users\[my-username]\skills directory

**STEP 5: Install Dependencies (Python & Git)**

Run the dependency installation script to install Chocolatey, Python, and Git. But always check with the user before proceeding to running scripts. You must never rewrite these scripts. You should only execute them.

```powershell
cd C:\Users\[my-username]\skills\windows-onboarding\scripts
.\install_dependencies.ps1
```

The script will:
- **CHECK** if Chocolatey package manager is installed (if not present, install it)
- **CHECK** if Python 3.x is installed (if not present, install in **NON-INTERACTIVE/SILENT MODE**)
- **CHECK** if Git is installed (if not present, install in **NON-INTERACTIVE/SILENT MODE**)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INSTALLATIONS:**

1. **Non-Interactive Mode**: All installations MUST use silent/quiet flags to avoid user prompts:
   - Chocolatey: Use `-y` flag (auto-confirm)
   - Python: Use `/quiet` or `/passive` installer flags
   - Git: Use `/VERYSILENT /NORESTART` flags

2. **PATH Configuration**: After each installation, the script MUST:
   - Add the tool's binary path to the system PATH environment variable
   - Verify the PATH was updated successfully
   - Test that PowerShell can find the tool by running:
     ```powershell
     # For Python
     python --version
     
     # For Git
     git --version
     ```
   - If commands fail, manually add to PATH:
     ```powershell
     # Add Python to PATH
     $pythonPath = "C:\Python3x"  # Adjust version as needed
     [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";$pythonPath;$pythonPath\Scripts", [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
     
     # Add Git to PATH
     $gitPath = "C:\Program Files\Git\cmd"
     [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $env:Path + ";$gitPath", [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)
     
     # Refresh environment variables in current session
     $env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
     ```

3. **Post-Installation Verification**: Before proceeding to Step 6, confirm:
   - `python --version` returns a valid version number
   - `git --version` returns a valid version number
   - Both commands work in a NEW PowerShell window (not just the current session). Test both.

Wait for the script to complete. If it asks me to close and reopen ChatWise for PATH changes, instruct me to:
1. Close ChatWise completely
2. Reopen using "ChatWise (Admin)" shortcut
3. Return to this conversation and verify tools are accessible

**STEP 6: Run Windows Onboarding Script**

Once dependencies are installed, run/execute the Windows onboarding adapter script:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\[my-username]\skills\windows-onboarding\scripts
python adapt_prompt.py
```

The script will first verify I'm running as Administrator. If it exits with an admin error:
1. Tell me I'm not running as admin
2. Instruct me to close ChatWise completely
3. Have me open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc)
4. Have me kill all 'chatwise.exe' and 'node.exe' processes
5. Have me double-click 'ChatWise (Admin)' shortcut
6. Have me return and run the script again

Once admin is verified, the script will continue.
The onboarding script will ask me for:
- My full name (e.g., "John Smith")
- My Windows username (e.g., "jsmith")
- My Google Drive email (optional, for cloud sync)

The script will generate:
- `system_prompt.md` - Customized system prompt for my machine
- `user_config.json` - User configuration file

After the script completes, it will show instructions for:
- Creating required directory structure
- Setting up Google Drive sync (optional)
- Applying the system prompt

**STEP 7: Summary**

Once all steps are complete, provide me with:
- Confirmation that all dependencies are installed
- Location of the generated system_prompt.md file
- Next steps for applying the system prompt to my ChatWise configuration

Please start with Step 1 now.
