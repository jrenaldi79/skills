# Life360 Imagery Style

## Core Philosophy: Human Connection
The Life360 brand visual language relies heavily on authentic lifestyle photography that depicts family safety and connection in the real world.

### Do's
-   **Authentic Moments:** Candid shots of families walking, talking, or engaging with each other.
-   **Safety in Action:** Teens studying, driving safely (interior shots), or parents checking their phones with peace of mind.
-   **Evergreen Content:** Avoid seasonal specificity (holiday lights, heavy winter coats) unless the communication is seasonally specific.
-   **Natural Lighting:** Bright, optimistic lighting. Subtle cool/purple grading is acceptable but skin tones should remain natural.

### Don'ts
-   **Abstract Gradients:** Avoid using large gradients as the *primary* visual interest. Use them only as overlays for text readability.
-   **Staged Stock:** Avoid "perfect" studio families looking at the camera.
-   **Map Overload:** While the map is our product, the *brand* is about the people on the map. Use UI screenshots sparingly or composited into real devices.

## Technical Guidelines
-   **Aspect Ratio:** For headers and banners, use cinematic wide crops (e.g., 3:1 or 2.4:1) to maintain screen real estate.
-   **Resolution:** Always source high-resolution assets (1200px+ width for web/email).
